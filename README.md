First, I recommended using ___ES module___ instead ___CommonJS___. It is more declarative and modern. In addition, we do not have to import each function separately, but immediately import everything we need from the module _"algoCard.js"_.

Also, pay attention to ___handleAttack___ method. This function is lengthy and somewhat complex. It can be made more efficient. As a result, it can be simplified by breaking it down into smaller, more focused methods:

1.  Method _checkGuessAccuracy(guessTarget, guessValue)_ can check if the guess is correct and returns the corresponding results, including whether the guess was correct, the insert index for the next card, and whether the game has been won.
2. Method _updateGameState(guessResult)_ can update the game state based on the _guessResult_ object, including updating the deck, player turns, and game status.
3. Method _emitAttackFeedback(guessResult)_ can emit the appropriate events _"correctMove"_ or _"wrongMove"_ based on the _guessResult_ object.

The ___emitLobbyUpdate___ and ___emitReadyUpdate___ functions share common logic for retrieving the user list from the room. To avoid code duplication, this logic can be extracted into a separate function named _getRoomUserList_.

Major point, implementation does not handle potential errors. It would be beneficial to add error-handling mechanisms to ensure that unexpected situations are handled clearly. 

Would be better to encapsulate room setup logic, because this logic for determining turn order and deck configuration seems repetitive in ___confirmReady___. It might be beneficial to create dedicated helper functions or move this logic to the __Room class__ itself.

Also for logging, we can use better mechanisms, which are provided, by external libraries that make reading logs more declarative and understandable.
